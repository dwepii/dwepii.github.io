  <h2>The World of Anime</h2>
  <img src="images/demonslayer.png" alt="Kimetsu no Yaiba | Demon Slayer" />
  <p>Anime is a globally recognized form of Japanese animation that spans genres from action and fantasy to romance and slice of life. It first gained momentum in the early 20th century and today stands as a multibillion-dollar industry influencing media worldwide.</p>

  <h3>Spotlight: Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer)</h3>
  <p><em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> is a highly acclaimed anime and manga series created by Koyoharu Gotouge. Set during Japan's Taisho era (1912–1926), it follows the journey of Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted boy who becomes a demon slayer after his family is slaughtered by demons and his sister Nezuko is turned into one.</p>

  <p>The series masterfully blends fantasy with Japanese folklore, featuring yōkai-inspired demons, traditional swordsmanship, and breathing techniques rooted in martial arts. The narrative incorporates historical aesthetics, such as Taisho-era clothing, old architecture, and cultural practices like family bonds and honor.</p>

  <h3>Visual and Cultural Style</h3>
  <p>Demon Slayer is also notable for its stunning animation style, traditional Japanese music, and art direction that mirrors ukiyo-e woodblock prints and seasonal nature symbolism. It pays homage to Japan’s cultural heritage while appealing to modern global audiences.</p>
